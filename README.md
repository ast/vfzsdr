# VFZSDR

This is a Linux Kernel Module for controlling SM6VFZ's FPGA based
Software Defined Radio.  More information in his repository
https://github.com/danupp/fpgasdr.

Refer
to
[register-map.org](https://github.com/danupp/fpgasdr/blob/master/docs/register-map.org) for
full documentation on the i2c based protocol.

# Building

To build Linux out-tree-modules you need to have the source for the
kernel you are using available.

On the Raspberry Pi an easy way to install the sources is the
`rpi-source` utility. Check https://github.com/notro/rpi-source/wiki
for full instructions.


```bash
# Install kernel sources
$ rpi-source

# Clone this repo
$ git clone https://github.com/ast/vfzsdr.git

# Build
$ make

# Load module
sudo insmod vfzsdr.ko

# Check for errors
# You should see some debug messages from the module
$ sudo dmesg

```

# Using

I have only tested on Raspberry Pi 3 but it will probably work on
other platforms.

The module will create a device at `/dev/vfzsdr`. You can read the
status byte from this device. To use this device as a memeber of the
group `i2c` you can install the provided `udev` rule:

```bash
# On debian based systems:
$ sudo cp 90-vfzsdr.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
```


```bash
# To use the options as a non-root user member of i2c group.
$ sudo chgrp -R i2c /sys/class/sdr/vfzsdr/

# To set audio gain to 10 (0 = max, 63 = mute):
$ echo 10 > /sys/class/sdr/vfzsdr/gain

# To set frequency to (close to) 14.000.000Hz:
$ echo 14000000 > /sys/class/sdr/vfzsdr/frequency

# To read frequency:
$ cat /sys/class/sdr/vfzsdr/frequency

# Read frequency, mode and filter width:
$ cat /sys/class/sdr/vfzsdr/status

# To change mode:
$ echo [AM|LSB|USB] > /sys/class/sdr/vfzsdr/mode

# To change filter width:
$ echo [n|w] > /sys/class/sdr/vfzsdr/filter

# To tune 10 hardware steps up:
$ echo 10 > /sys/class/sdr/vfzsdr/tune
# A hardware step is 120Mhz/2^25 = 3.5762...Hz

# Tune down:
$ echo -10 > /sys/class/sdr/vfzsdr/tune
```


# Bugs

Probably many. This is an initial release. **Use at your own risk**.

* Some functions are still not implemented.
